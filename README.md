# Watchlistarr

<img src="watchlistarr.png" alt="Alternate Text" width="240"/>

Sync plex watchlists in realtime with Sonarr and Radarr. **Requires Plex Pass**

**Requires Sonarr v4**

## Why?

### Sonarr/Radarr limitation

While Sonarr and Radarr have built-in functionality (in v4 and v3 respectively), they are set at 6 hour refresh
intervals, and cannot be customized

### Ombi/Overseer limitation

While Ombi and Overseer have built-in functionality, there are a few problems with this:

* They are customizable down to 5 minute intervals, so doesn't allow the "real-time" sync that Watchlistarr does
* They rely on Plex tokens, which expire and break the sync if you're not regularly logging into Ombi/Overseer
* They can only sync the current user's watchlist. If you have friends you've added to your Plex server, you won't be
  able to sync their watchlist

## Getting Started

### Docker
The easiest way to try this code is using docker:

```bash
docker run \
  -e SONARR_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY \
  -e RADARR_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY \
  -e PLEX_WATCHLIST_URL_1=YOUR_PLEX_WATCHLIST_URL \
  nylonee/watchlistarr
```

Docker tag options:

* `latest` - Stable version, follows the Releases
* `beta` - Beta version, follows the main branch
* `alpha` - Experimental version, follows the latest successful PR build

### Java
Running this using native java requires the fat jar, download the latest from the Releases tab, and run:
```bash
java -jar watchlistarr.java\
  -Dsonarr.apikey=YOUR_API_KEY\
  -Dradarr.apikey=YOUR_API_KEY\
  -Dplex.watchlist1=YOUR_PLEX_WATCHLIST_URL
```
For a full list of options to pass in and how they relate to the environment variable, see [entrypoint.sh](https://github.com/nylonee/watchlistarr/blob/main/docker/entrypoint.sh)

### Getting your Plex Watchlist URLs

1. Go to [Watchlist settings in Plex](https://app.plex.tv/desktop/#!/settings/watchlist)
2. Generate RSS Feeds for the watchlists you want to monitor, and copy those URLs

## Developers Corner

Build the docker image:

```
docker build -t nylonee/watchlistarr:latest -f docker/Dockerfile .
